# Paragon Hero Stats

I developed this site when I started learning Ember, which is similar to React and Angular. Development was abandoned on it, however it was in a useful state when it was abandoned. All of the commits are to the master branch, which worked for this, but I do have a good understanding of git, and at my job I work with many other developers, so we of course have a develop branch, and make pull requests to that.

Please visit [https://alexpodworny.com/heroes](https://alexpodworny.com/heroes) to view the latest release version of the site, and if you want to run the site yourself, please follow the below instructions. Note that if you do, you will be viewing a development version.
